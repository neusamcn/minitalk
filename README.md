## Description

The goal is to build a small message-passing system where a client program sends a string to a server program, using only UNIX signals as the communication mechanism.
We could also call this a custom inter-process communication (IPC) protocol on top of UNIX signals.



## Instructions

1. Compile the project with `make all`.
2. Open 2 terminal windows at the root of the project folder.
3. From one window we'll start the server program: `./server`
4. In other windows we start the client program, adding the PID that was provided by `./server` and a message, as following: `./client server_PID "message"`
5. Confirm messages are received from different terminals.
6. Use `kill server_PID` at the server's terminal to end the program gracefully.

### Recommendations for testing:
- For a complete leak check and cleaner outputs:
	- Server:

			valgrind --log-file=valg_server_log.log --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all -s ./server

	- Client (for each message sent):
		
			valgrind --log-file=valg_client_log.log --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all -s ./client server_PID "message"
- To check the time it takes to display 100 characters (should be under 1 second):

		time ./client "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 0123456789 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJ"
